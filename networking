Network protocol:

TCP/IP
     (1) reliable
     (2) packet are deliver in the correct seq
     (3) preformance is not as fast since more work are required
     (4) point to point (not broadcast base)
     (5) able to communicate cross network

UDP/IP
     (1) do not guarante delivery
     (2) faster than TCP/IP since it did a lot less in "control"
     (3) broadcast base so send one packet and multiple people 
		will able to recive the packet.
     (4) Usually will only able to broadcast in the same network.

multicast vs unicast
Multicast typical will require "multicast router to do this"
     (1) Support multiple networks
     (2) Using UDP
     (2) packet
     (3) Multicast allow net

Implementation:
     Current implementation of the network api are via socket interface.

what is OSI model:
     OSI is a suggestion model(idea) of how network suppose to be implemented.
     It seperated the implementation into seven different parts,
         each part of the implemention will be a lot to under and create.

     Bask in the 80s, the TCP/IP network didn't exist under "UNIX" enviroment.
     IBM and many big cooparations tried to implement 
         but failed (more than 3 yrss)
     Bill Joy pick the document of TCP/IP RFC and start his own implementation.
         He created the basic socket communication under UNIX envirment (BSD).
         The first protype take him (team) two week to deliver.

     The socket libray become the "de facto" communicate for the past 30yrs.
     People still try to explain the socket with OSI. (what is joke!)


########### Important concepts
UNDERSTAND OF BYTE ordering

	big endian vs little endian
	networking byte order is using "big endian"

SOCKET PROGRAMMING

There is three different type interface construct for networking programming.

(1) read/write
(2) control - socket, bind, connect, accept, ioctl
(3) data struct (db) - struct inet_addr, 
      struct hostent *gethostbyname(const char *name);
      struct hostent *gethostbyaddr(const void *addr, socklen_t len, int type);

(A) socket communication basically utilize generic UNIX: read/write.
(B) control are via ioctl
(C) data struct use to specify requirement for the underline interface
      i.e. struct hostent -> to specify a host or group of host
        
######
Command useful for network programming.

netstat - can be use to figure out what the current net related ports.
lsof - can be use to find out what port is in use and who is using it.
route - so the routing information
